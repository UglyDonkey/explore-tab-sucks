I was frustrated by accidentally clicked 'explore' so here is my extension.

It's tested on chrome and firefox.

## Installation

Extension it's not published in extension stores (for now), so you have to install it manually by downloading zip from [release page](https://github.com/UglyDonkey/explore-tab-sucks/releases) and install in your browser.

### Boring but important information
Installing any extension using that methode can be insecure. It's actually avoiding built-in security features in your browser. Never trust to anyone who tells you to do that. Here, fortunately, it's small and simple extension, so you can check if I try to steal your private data or do any other bad thing witch extensions can do in a minute. Seriously, I'm not kidding, go now and check that code before start using it.

#### Chrome users

Open `chrome://extensions`, turn on developer mode and drag downloaded file. Disable developer mode to prevent you from accidentally dropping another extension.

#### Firefox users

Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click `Load Temporary Add-on...` and select downloaded zip. Unfortunately, it loads as temporary extension witch is removed when that tab is closed.
